         <p>Hi, I'm osici. Here are various Minecraft screenshots I took in 2009. They are mainly of maps I made using my editor (<a href="index.html">Omen</a>, originally OME) and were posted on the forums and elsewhere. Most of them have since disappeared from the web so I've reuploaded them here. </p>
